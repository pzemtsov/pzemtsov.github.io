I've been using this construct since I started programming in **C**.
I didn't come to it myself, but I don't recall anyone teaching it to me explicitly either.
It was common knowledge back then. I was completely sure it was still common knowledge until very recently.
One colleague asked me about it during a routine code inspection procedure, and I couldn't explain it then.
I'll try to do it now.

The syntax of a macro invocation with parameters in **C/C++** is identical to that of a function call.
In some cases it can cause confusion but usually it is convenient, because it makes it possible to switch from
function implementation to macro and back:

{% highlight C++ %}
#if MACRO
    #define add(x,y) ((x)+(y))
#else
    static int add (int x, int y) { return x + y; }
#endif
{% endhighlight %}

The same applies to `void` functions:

{% highlight C++ %}
#if MACRO
    #define dump(x) printf ("x=%d\n", x)
#else
    static void dump (int x) { printf ("x=%d\n", x); }
#endif
{% endhighlight %}

One can call `dump(x)` anywhere in the code without knowing if it is a function or a macro.

Now consider the following problem: make a void function-style macro with two (or more) statements in it.
Take the following function:

{% highlight C++ %}
void set_value (int new_value)
{
    printf ("Changing value from %d to %d\n", x, new_value);
    x = new_value;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Now we want to convert it into a macro:

{% highlight C++ %}
#define set_value(new_value) printf ("Changing value from %d to %d\n",\
                                     x, new_value);\
                             x = new_value
{% endhighlight %}

It is easy to see why it is wrong. These are two statements instead of one, so it won't work where exactly one
statement is expected:

{% highlight C++ %}
If (some_condition)
    set_value (1);
{% endhighlight %}

which will expand as

{% highlight C++ %}
If (some_condition)
    printf ("Changing value from %d to %d\n",
            x, 1);
    x = 1;
{% endhighlight %}

The `printf` will be called if `some_condition` is true, while `x` will be assigned `1` in any case.

In our specific example there is another thing that is wrong: it can't handle parameters with side-effects. It is
sufficient to try calling

{% highlight C++ %}
    set_value (y++);
{% endhighlight %}

and see what happens.

Ok, then, maybe wrapping in curly brackets will work? It could fix both problems:

{% highlight C++ %}
#define set_value(new_value)  {\
        int v = new_value;\
        printf ("Changing value from %d to %d\n", x, v);\
        x = v;\
    }
{% endhighlight %}

The reason this won't work is more subtle: it is that **C** requires semicolon after any statement except for compound
statement. A function call is followed by a semicolon; but if we put semicolon after this macro invocation,
we'll have two statements: a compound statement and an empty statement. There are places where exactly one statement
is allowed, for instance in the `if` statement:

{% highlight C++ %}
if (condition)
    set_value (1);
else
    something_else ();
{% endhighlight %}

This will be expanded as

{% highlight C++ %}
if (condition)
{
    int v = 1;
    printf ("Changing value from %d to %d\n", x, v);
    x = v;
};
else
    something_else ();
{% endhighlight %}

This won't compile, because the empty statement (a solitary semicolon) effectively terminates any `if` statements
that were opened at that point. On a positive side, it just won't compile; previous solution compiled but didn't work.
However, we can do better.

What we need is some structure that naturally ends with a semicolon but allows many statements inside.
This is where a `do` statement comes handy:

{% highlight C++ %}
#define set_value(new_value)  do {\
    int v = new_value;\
    printf ("Changing value from %d to %d\n", x, v);\
    x = v;\
} while (0)
{% endhighlight %}

(I remind you that a `while` condition in a `do` statement is a post-condition: it is checked after the iteration;
this means that this `do` loop executes exactly once).

The above example is then expanded as

{% highlight C++ %}
if (condition)
    do {
        int v = 1;
        printf ("Changing value from %d to %d\n", x, v);
        x = v;
    } while (0);
else
    something_else ();
{% endhighlight %}

and this compiles correctly.

For some people this looks like an ugly hack; for others it looks like a beautiful hack.
Languages that do not require semicolons (such as **Go**), or languages that allow multiple statements everywhere
automatically (such as **Modula-2**) don't experience this difficulty; but usually they don't have macros either,
so the problem is not relevant there.

P.S.
----

In the above example I deliberately pretended that I didn't know the comma operator. Many multi-statement
macros do not allow implementation using comma, but this specific example does. The first na&iuml;ve attempt

{% highlight C++ %}
#define set_value(new_value) printf ("Changing value from %d to %d\n",\
                                     x, x = new_value)
{% endhighlight %}

fails miserably. **C** does not guarantee the order of execution of function parameters, and the behaviour is
undefined. In `gcc` the order is exactly the opposite to the one we wanted, so this code

{% highlight C++ %}
x = 10;
set_value(15);
{% endhighlight %}

prints

    Changing value from 15 to 15

This is a better code:

{% highlight C++ %}
#define set_value(new_value) printf ("Changing value from %d to %d\n",\
                                     x, new_value)\
                             , x = new_value
{% endhighlight %}

This code works, but suffers from mentioned side-effect issue. This can be resolved, too, by using a global variable:

{% highlight C++ %}
int v;
#define set_value(new_value) v = new_value \
                             , printf ("Changing value from %d to %d\n", x, v)\
                             , x = v
{% endhighlight %}

but this is definitely an ugly hack.

P.P.S.
------

There are still cases where one can use functions but not macros of this type. I can think of two. One is where
two void functions are combined using comma operator:

{% highlight C++ %}
f(), g();
{% endhighlight %}

Neither of them can be replaced with a macro using the `do` technique. Another case if a `for` statement:

{% highlight C++ %}
for (f(); g(); h())
   p();
{% endhighlight %}

Here `f()` and `h()` can be `void` functions but not macros with compound statements inside. Fortunately, these are
exotic cases.

P.P.P.S.
--------

There is at least one more language construct (apart from `do`) that can be used this way. This is the `if` statement:

{% highlight C++ %}
#define set_value(new_value)  if (1) {\
    int v = new_value;\
    printf ("Changing value from %d to %d\n", x, v);\
    x = v;\
} else
{% endhighlight %}
