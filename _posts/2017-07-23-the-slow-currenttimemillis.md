Today we'll look at one of the most basic and the most often used methods from the **Java** library: `System.currentTimeMillis()`.

This method reports current time with the millisecond accuracy. One may think that, because of this, the performance of this method is irrelevant. Who cares if obtaining current
time takes 0.1 or 0.2 ms if the measured interval is 100 or 500 milliseconds long? There are, however, cases when we might still want to invoke this method frequently.
Here are the examples:

- Detecting and reporting abnormally long execution times. For instance, we can measure the time it takes to execute an HTTP request. In most cases
(we hope) it takes below one milliseconds, which will report as zero if we use this method, but we want to be alarmed if the measured time
is abnormally long (e.g. exceeds 100 ms). In this case we'll time every request, and there may be hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of them per second.

- Obtaining timestamps to be associated with some objects, for instance, with cached data -- to arrange time-based eviction from a cache.

- Measuring the duration of some long, but frequently initiated asynchronous processes, such as requests to remote servers.

- Time-stamping some real-world events. For instance, a trading system may wish to record timestamps of incoming orders and performed deals.

In short, despite rather low accuracy of this method, there are cases when it can be called very often, so a very valid question arises: what is the performance
of this method?

Measuring speed
---------------

The way to test the performance of `currentTimeMillis()` is straightforward: we call it many times, while making sure that it isn't optimised out altogether:

{% highlight Java %}
static void test_milli_speed ()
{
    long sum = 0;
    int N = 100000000;
    long t1 = System.currentTimeMillis ();
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) 
        sum += System.currentTimeMillis ();
    long t2 = System.currentTimeMillis ();
    System.out.println ("Sum = " + sum + "; time = " + (t2 - t1) +
        "; or " + (t2 - t1) * 1.0E6 / N + " ns / iter");
}
{% endhighlight %}
    
Running it on Windows (my notebook, which is Windows 10, Core i7-6820HQ @2.7GHz), using Java 1.8.0_92, we get:

    >java Time
    Sum = 2276735854871496107; time = 393; or 3.93 ns / iter
    Sum = 2276735892808191170; time = 382; or 3.82 ns / iter
    Sum = 2276735930338889327; time = 379; or 3.79 ns / iter

This is very good result. When time is reported in 3.8 ns, we can put time request instructions just about anywhere. We can measure time of any operation and
attach timestamp to any resource. It is virtually free. We can query time 260 million times per second.

Let's run it on Linux. The one I use for testing is of RHEL flavour with a kernel version of 3.17.4, and it runs on a dual Xeon&reg; CPU E5-2620 v3 @ 2.40GHz.

    # java Time
    Sum = 1499457980079543330; time = 652; or 652.0 ns / iter
    Sum = 1499457980725968363; time = 642; or 642.0 ns / iter
    Sum = 1499457981368550493; time = 643; or 643.0 ns / iter

We had to reduce the iteration count by a couple of zeroes (make it one million), because the test runs two hundred times longer. The average time to query time in Linux
is 640 ns, which is more than half a microsecond. We can only execute this call 1.5 million times per second.

This is really shocking, and it means for us that we must be careful with our use of `currentTimeMillis()` on Linux. While still applicable for measuring
time of sequential long operations, this method can't really be used for the tasks listed above.

Why is this and what can be done?

Windows version
---------------

The `currentTimeMillis()` is a native function. Its code can be found in [OpenJDK distribution](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8), where it is linked to `JVM_CurrentTimeMillis`
(file [`hotspot/src/share/vm/prims/jvm.cpp`](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8/jdk8/hotspot/file/87ee5ee27509/src/share/vm/prims/jvm.cpp)), which eventually ends up at `os::javaTimeMillis()`. This call is OS-dependent.

The Windows version of this code ([`hotspot/src/os/windows/vm/jvm.cpp/os_windows.cpp`](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8/jdk8/hotspot/file/87ee5ee27509/src/os/windows/vm/os_windows.cpp)) looks like this:

{% highlight C++ %}
jlong os::javaTimeMillis() {
  if (UseFakeTimers) {
    return fake_time++;
  } else {
    FILETIME wt;
    GetSystemTimeAsFileTime(&wt);
    return windows_to_java_time(wt);
  }
}

jlong windows_to_java_time(FILETIME wt) {
  jlong a = jlong_from(wt.dwHighDateTime, wt.dwLowDateTime);
  return (a - offset()) / 10000;
}

static jlong  _offset   = 116444736000000000;

jlong offset() {
  return _offset;
}
{% endhighlight %}

**Java** time is based on `GetSystemTimeAsFileTime()`, which returns a `FILETIME`. This structure dates back to 32-bit systems, and consists of two 32-bit fields,
`dwHighDateTime` and `dwLowDateTime`, which, combined together, define a 64-bit number of 100-nanosecond intervals since the epoch time.

In MSVC, we can call this function and trace its execution in a debugger. The disassembly in the 32-bit mode shows its code:

{% highlight asm %}
7691C450  mov         edi,edi
7691C452  push        ebp
7691C453  mov         ebp,esp
7691C455  push        ebx
7691C456  push        esi
7691C457  push        edi
7691C458  mov         esi,7FFE0018h
7691C45D  mov         edi,7FFE0014h
7691C462  mov         ebx,7FFE001Ch
7691C467  mov         eax,dword ptr [esi]
7691C469  mov         edx,dword ptr [edi]
7691C46B  mov         ecx,dword ptr [ebx]
7691C46D  cmp         eax,ecx
7691C46F  jne         7691C480
7691C471  mov         ecx,dword ptr [ebp+8]
7691C474  pop         edi
7691C475  pop         esi
7691C476  pop         ebx
7691C477  mov         dword ptr [ecx],edx
7691C479  mov         dword ptr [ecx+4],eax
7691C47C  pop         ebp
7691C47D  ret         4
7691C480  pause
7691C482  jmp         7691C467
{% endhighlight %}

This is indeed very clever. The function contains no system calls. Everything happens in the user space. There is a memory area that is mapped into the address space
of every process. Some background thread regularly updates three double-words there, which contain the high part of the value, the low part, and the high part again.
The client reads all three, in this order, and, if the two high parts are equal, the low part is considered consistent with them (the strong memory access ordering of x86
guarantees this). If not, the procedure must be repeated. This is very unlikely event, that's why the entire procedure is so fast.

The function looks even better in the 64-bit mode:

{% highlight asm %}
00007FF90970CE80  mov         eax,7FFE0014h
00007FF90970CE85  mov         rax,qword ptr [rax]
00007FF90970CE88  mov         dword ptr [rcx],eax
00007FF90970CE8A  shr         rax,20h
00007FF90970CE8E  mov         dword ptr [rcx+4],eax 
00007FF90970CE91  ret
{% endhighlight %}

Here the background thread can write the value atomically, and the client can atomically read it. Actually, the code could have been even better -- we could write a 64-bit value in one instruction:

{% highlight asm %}
                  mov         eax,7FFE0014h
                  mov         rax,qword ptr [rax]
                  mov         qword ptr [rcx],rax
                  ret
{% endhighlight %}

However, the code is much faster than any possible system call anyway.

What is the resolution of this timer? Let's collect the values into an array and print it later:

{% highlight C %}
#define N 1000000
int values[N];

int main(void)
{
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        FILETIME f;
        GetSystemTimeAsFileTime (&f);
        values[i] = (int) f.dwLowDateTime;
    }

    for (i = 1; i < N; i++)
        if (values[i-1] != values[i])
            printf("%d %d\n", i, values[i] - values[i-1]);

    return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

The output is:

    68208 5044
    214315 5015
    362575 5037
    508633 4987
    654960 5022
    800065 5007
    943784 5041

The timer ticks roughly once every half a millisecond (2000 Hz). This is perfectly adequate to serve as a base of `currentTimeMillis()`.


Linux version
-------------

This happened to be much longer journey than I expected. We start at another version of `os::javaTimeMillis()`, in 
[`hotspot/src/os/linux/vm/os_linux.cpp`](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8/jdk8/hotspot/file/87ee5ee27509/src/os/linux/vm/os_linux.cpp):

{% highlight C++ %}
jlong os::javaTimeMillis() {
  timeval time;
  int status = gettimeofday(&time, NULL);
  assert(status != -1, "linux error");
  return jlong(time.tv_sec) * 1000  +  jlong(time.tv_usec / 1000);
}
{% endhighlight %}

It is very unlikely that the time is spent in multiplication or division by 1000, but let's measure the performance of `gettimeofday` anyway:

{% highlight C %}
volatile uint64_t tt;

int main (void)
{
  int i;
  int N = 10000000;

  struct timeval time;
  uint64_t t0 = 0;

  for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    gettimeofday (&time, 0);
    tt = time.tv_sec * (uint64_t) 1000000 + time.tv_usec;
    if (t0 == 0) t0 = tt;
  }
  printf ("Time for %d: %f s; %f ns\n",
          N, (tt - t0) * 1.0E-6, (tt - t0) * 1.0E3 / N);
  return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Running it, we get:

    Time for 10000000: 6.251108 s; 625.110800 ns

The call to `gettimeofday` is indeed slow. Why? Is there perhaps some system call involved?
Let's run it in the `gdb`. After we have stepped into the call of `gettimeofday`, we see this:

{% highlight asm %}
Dump of assembler code for function gettimeofday@plt:
=> 0x0000000000400460 <+0>:     jmpq   *0x200bba(%rip)        # 0x601020 <gettimeofday@got.plt>
   0x0000000000400466 <+6>:     pushq  $0x1
   0x000000000040046b <+11>:    jmpq   0x400440
{% endhighlight %}
 
The first `jmpq` in fact jumps to the next instruction (`+6`), and eventually we end up in a function called `_dl_runtime_resolve`.

What is actually happening here is that we are linking to the `vDSO` ([virtual dynamic shared object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VDSO)), which is a small fully relocatable shared library
pre-mapped into the user address space. The linking happens during the first call of `gettimeofday`, after which the call is resolved, and the first indirect jump
goes straight into the function. Let's skip this execution and break before the next call to `gettimeofday`. The function looks the same:

{% highlight asm %}
=> 0x0000000000400460 <+0>:     jmpq   *0x200bba(%rip)        # 0x601020 <gettimeofday@got.plt>
{% endhighlight %}

but this time the jump takes us to the real implementation. Here it is, with some added comments:

The vDSO is mapped to a new address each time (probably, some security feature). However, the function is always placed at the same address as above (`0x00007ffff7ffae50`)
when run under `gdb` (I'm not sure what causes this). The function accesses some memory at addresses not far from its code (such as `0x7ffff7ff8080` or `0x7ffff7ff90f0`), always using
the "relative-to-IP" addressing mode. This makes this function completely relocatable -- it can be mapped to any address in the user space, together with all its
data.

We can see that the function employs various options. It can make a `syscall`, it can execute an `rdtsc` instruction, or it can just read some memory (in a similar
fashion to the Windows implementation). Which of these options is applied in our case?

Let's look at the [source code of our version of Linux kernel (3.17.4)](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/releases/tag/v3.17). Note that this is not the latest one (Linux distributors are very conservative people). The code
of the latest one differs quite a bit (including some constant definitions). Here is the code (in [`arch/x86/vdso/vclock_gettime.c`](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/bfe01a5ba2490f299e1d2d5508cbbbadd897bbe9/arch/x86/vdso/vclock_gettime.c)):

{
    if (likely(tv != NULL)) {
        if (unlikely(do_realtime((struct timespec *)tv) == VCLOCK_NONE))
            return vdso_fallback_gtod(tv, tz);
        tv->tv_usec /= 1000;
    }
    if (unlikely(tz != NULL)) {
        tz->tz_minuteswest = gtod->tz_minuteswest;
        tz->tz_dsttime = gtod->tz_dsttime;
    }

    return 0;
}

Here is the rest of the code (`gtod`, obviously, stands for `gettimeofday`). In

What is going on here is very close to what happened in Windows. There is a data structure that accompanies the vDSO and is mapped to the address space of every
process. It is called `vvar_vsyscall_gtod_data` and is addressed in the code via the pseudo-variable `gtod`. In the assembly listing above this structure sits at
the address `0x7ffff7ff8080`.

Some background thread updates the fields of this structure at regular intervals. Since there are more than two of these fields, the Windows trick of writing the
high part of the number twice doesn't work. However, a similar trick works. The writer maintains a version number of the data in the structure (the `seq` field).
It gets incremented by one when the writer starts updating the structure, and again by one after it finishes (with appropriate write barrier instruction being used).
As a result, the odd value means that the data isn't consistent. The reader must read the number, make sure it's even (wait a bit using `pause` instruction if not), read all the values of
interest from the structure, read the version number again, and if it is the same as in the beginning, the data is considered correct. This is what `gtod_read_begin`
and `gtod_read_retry` functions are for.

Read barrier instructions must be used to make sure that the processor didn't re-order reading the version number with reading of the actual data. However,
the strong memory ordering of Intel x86 makes this unnecessary, so the read barrier call (`smp_rnb()`) is empty in our case.

The values of interest are `wall_time_sec` and `wall_time_snsec`. The first one is the proper number of seconds since the epoch as reported by the good old
`time()` call. In fact, `time()` is implemented by reading exactly this value, and without any locking or version control:

{% highlight C %}
notrace time_t __vdso_time(time_t *t)
{
	/* This is atomic on x86 so we don't need any locks. */
	time_t result = ACCESS_ONCE(gtod->wall_time_sec);

	if (t)
		*t = result;
	return result;
}
{% endhighlight %}

The second value is the nanoseconds time, relative to the last second, shifted left by `gtod->shift`, Or, rather, it the time measured in some
units, which becomes the nanosecond time when shifted right by `gtod->shift`, which, in our case, is 25. This is very high precision.
One nanosecond divided by 2<sup>25</sup> is about 30 attoseconds. Perhaps, Linux kernel designers looked far ahead, anticipating the future when we'll need such
accuracy for our time measurement.

What is the real resolution of these time values? Let's read these values in a loop and print them when they change.

Unless we want to run the program in `gdb`, we must first resolve the `vDSO` relocation. That's easy:

{% highlight C %}
const struct vsyscall_gtod_data * gtod = 0;

void resolve (void)
{
  unsigned char * p;
  struct timeval time;
  gettimeofday (&time, 0);
  p = (char *) gettimeofday;

  if (p[0] != 0xFF || p[1] != 0x25) {
    exit (1);
  }
  p += 6 + *(int32_t*) (p+2);
  p = * (unsigned char **) p;
  p -= (unsigned) (intptr_t) p & 0xFFF;
  p -= 0x2000;
  p += 0x80;
  gtod = (const struct vsyscall_gtod_data *) p;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Now we can run a loop to detect change in `wall_time_snsec`:

{% highlight C %}
void test (void)
{
  int i;
  uint64_t oldns = 0;

  for (i = 0; i < 10000000; i++) {
      uint64_t ns = gtod->wall_time_snsec;
      if (ns != oldns) {
          printf ("%d: sec=%lu ns=%lu diff=%ld ns_shift=%lu diff_shift=%ld\n",
               i, gtod->wall_time_sec, ns, ns - oldns, ns >> gtod->shift,
               (ns >> gtod->shift) - (oldns >> gtod->shift));
      }
      oldns = ns;
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

A typical fragment of the output:

    3721507: sec=1499630953 ns=16894552383987602 diff=33554102663246 ns_shift=503496896 diff_shift=999990
    4367859: sec=1499630953 ns=16928106486650848 diff=33554102663246 ns_shift=504496886 diff_shift=999990
    5014216: sec=1499630953 ns=16961660589326449 diff=33554102675601 ns_shift=505496877 diff_shift=999991

We see that the `wall_time_nsec` value is updated rather infrequently: for about 650000 iterations it stays the same and then jumps by a big value, which,
being shifted by `shift`, becomes 999990 ns, or almost exactly one millisecond. It's also interesting to see what happens when `wall_time_sec` changes:

    249316536: sec=1499631433 ns=33542778622228903 diff=33554096688437 ns_shift=999652702 diff_shift=999990
    250511726: sec=1499631434 ns=21900718852443 diff=-33520877903376460 ns_shift=652692 diff_shift=-999000010

The new nanosecond value doesn't start at zero; it starts at 652692, which is over half a millisecond. It's not always that big -- I saw values of 200K and 300K.
In short, two variables available in the `gtod` structure provide very fast access to a rather coarse time value with a one millisecond resolution. Just like in Windows.

However, `gettimeofday()` does not stop here. It tries to improve accuracy using other methods. In the code above this is what the `vgetsns()` function is responsible
for:

{% highlight C %}
notrace static inline u64 vgetsns(int *mode)
{
	u64 v;
	cycles_t cycles;

	if (gtod->vclock_mode == VCLOCK_TSC)
		cycles = vread_tsc();
#ifdef CONFIG_HPET_TIMER
	else if (gtod->vclock_mode == VCLOCK_HPET)
		cycles = vread_hpet();
#endif
#ifdef CONFIG_PARAVIRT_CLOCK
	else if (gtod->vclock_mode == VCLOCK_PVCLOCK)
		cycles = vread_pvclock(mode);
#endif
	else
		return 0;
	v = (cycles - gtod->cycle_last) & gtod->mask;
	return v * gtod->mult;
}
{% endhighlight %}

The idea is that somewhere in the system there is a high-frequency timer, which we can ask for a current tick count. We record the reading of that timer at the
last tick of the coarse timer (`gtod->cycle_last`), and get the difference. The `gtod->mask` and `gtod->mult` fields help convert the reading of that timer to our
30-attosecond units. This can explain the choice of those units: it's not that Linux designers wanted to measure times of molecular processes; the unit is chosen very small
to reduce the errors during this conversion.

The code above provides for three types of high-frequency timers: `TSC` (based on the `RDTSC` instruction of Intel x86 instruction set), `HPET` (based on the external
hardware, the HPET chip), and `PVCLOCK`, which, most probably, has something to do with running in the VM environment.

In any case, the code only makes use of the high-precision timer to get the offset from the coarse time. The timer doesn't have to run very stable for years. It is
only supposed to be stable enough to provide the time offset between the coarse timer ticks. Moreover, its clock frequency may vary, as long as that variance is
known to the system and reflected in appropriate update of the `mask` and `mult` fields. The system is very well designed to provide very accurate time very fast.
So what went wrong?

In our case, the `vclock_mode` field is set to 2, which means using the HPET ([High Precision Event Timer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Precision_Event_Timer)). This timer is a hardware piece included into all modern PCs: a replacement of
the good old 8253/8254 chip. That chip ran a counter, which, upon reaching zero, could trigger an interrupt, and could also be read directly using `IN` instructions. It ran at the
frequency of 1.19318 MHz, and, if programmed to expire every 65536 clocks, caused an interrupt every 55 ms (18.2 Hz), which we all remember since the MS DOS days.

The HPET runs at higher frequency, counts up rather than down, and is available via memory-mapped I/O rather than I/O ports. The routine to read the counter looks like this:

{% highlight C %}
static notrace cycle_t vread_hpet(void)
{
	return *(const volatile u32 *)(&hpet_page + HPET_COUNTER);
}
{% endhighlight %}

This is compiled into just one 32-bit memory read instruction:

{% highlight asm %}
   0x00007ffff7ffb070 <+544>:   mov    -0x1f86(%rip),%eax        # 0x7ffff7ff90f0
{% endhighlight %}

The entire `gettimeofday` in the case of a HPET time source is compiled into a sequence of memory reads plus some shifts and multiplications. No divisions or
other expensive operations are present. Why is it then executing so slowly?

I didn't have a sampling profiler available on the test machine, but there is a poor man's solution: to attach `gdb` to a running program that executes `gettimeofday` in a loop, and then interrupt it.
In all the cases that I tried it it always stopped at exactly one place: after the above-mentioned instruction (at `gettimeofdat+550`). This indicates that that instructions
alone takes most of the execution time. This is easy to verify. Let's resolve the `hpet_page` in a similar way to resolving `vsyscall_gtod_data` and read this variable
in a loop:

    Time for 1000000: 0.564707 s;  ns/iter=564.707000

It takes more than half a microsecond to read the data from a HPET timer, which makes it a very slow time source. If we print the values we read from this timer,
we'll see that, unlike in the case of `gtod->wall_time_snsec`, the values change each time we access the timer. The typical difference is 8, which means that the timer
ticks 8 times while being read. The timer's accuracy is way higher than its performance. The difference between timer values measured at the points when the
coarse nanoseconds change (which, as we learned, happens every millisecond), is 14320, which means that the HPET frequency is 14.32 MHz (70&nbsp;ns per tick)..

This is really sad: the timer runs at high frequency, but there is no way to read it at this frequency. We can read it at about 1.8 MHz, which is just a bit higher than
the frequency of the MS DOS timer.

And the worst part is that in our use case we are in fact uninterested in such a high accuracy anyway -- all we need is `currentTimeMillis()`, and the coarse
timer is perfectly suitable for that.

The coarse timer
----------------

There is an easy way out, because the coarse timer is available via the user API: the `clock_gettime()` function:

{% highlight C %}
int clock_gettime(clockid_t clk_id, struct timespec *tp);
{% endhighlight %}

Among multiple values defined in `<time.h>` for `clk_id` there is one that does exactly what we need: `CLOCK_REALTIME_COARSE` (value 5).
The code for this function is present in the same vDSO (`vclock_gettime.c`):

{% highlight C %}
notrace static void do_realtime_coarse(struct timespec *ts)
{
    unsigned long seq;
    do {
        seq = gtod_read_begin(gtod);
        ts->tv_sec = gtod->wall_time_coarse_sec;
        ts->tv_nsec = gtod->wall_time_coarse_nsec;
    } while (unlikely(gtod_read_retry(gtod, seq)));
}
{% endhighlight %}

The nanosecond times reported by this function are 999991 ns (1 ms) apart, and the execution takes 8.4 ns.

The TSC time source
-------------------

We've learned that the slow execution of `currentTimeMillis()` was caused by two factors:

- **JVM** using `gettimeofday()` instead of `clock_gettime()`
- `gettimeofday()` being very slow if HPET time source is used.

HPET, however, isn't the only time source these days. Perhaps, not even the most common: many systems use TSC. This could make the entire study irrelevant. However, in our project
the servers are configured with the HPET time source for a reason: this time source integrated well with the NTP client, allowing for smooth
time adjustment, while TSC was not as stable (I don't know the details; this is what the local Linux gurus say and I have no option but to trust them).
Some other developers may find themselves in the same situation. Besides, a **Java** developer can't always know what time source will be configured on the machine the
program will run. That's why I feel that the findings made so far are still important.

However, it is still interesting to find out how the result would change if we used the TSC time source. TSC stands for the _time stamp counter_,
which is simply the number of CPU cycles counted since the startup time (it is only 64-bit wide, so it will wrap around in 243 years at 2.4GHz clock rate).
This value can be read using `rdtsc` instruction. Traditionally, there were two problems with this value:

- the values from different cores or physical processors may be shifted against each other, as the processors may start at different times
- the clock frequency of a processor may change during execution.

The first one seems to be indeed a problem. I tried getting the `rdtsc` value from several cores at once, synchronised on writing into some memory location.
Even in the best case I got differences of a couple of thousand cycles. Sometimes more. However, this is only a problem if the programmer wants to use the TSC
manually; in this case the thread affinity must be set accordingly. The OS knows when it re-schedules threads from one core to another, so it can make all necessary adjustments.

The second problem seems to be a thing of the past. The Intel doc says this:

> Processor families increment the time-stamp counter differently:
>
> - For Pentium M processors (family [06H], models [09H, 0DH]); for Pentium 4
> processors, Intel Xeon processors (family [0FH], models [00H, 01H, or 02H]);
> and for P6 family processors: the time-stamp counter increments with every
> internal processor clock cycle.
> The internal processor clock cycle is determined by the current core-clock to busclock
> ratio. Intel&reg; SpeedStep&reg; technology transitions may also impact the
> processor clock.
>
> - For Pentium 4 processors, Intel Xeon processors (family [0FH], models [03H and
> higher]); for Intel Core Solo and Intel Core Duo processors (family [06H], model
> [0EH]); for the Intel Xeon processor 5100 series and Intel Core 2 Duo processors
> (family [06H], model [0FH]); for Intel Core 2 and Intel Xeon processors (family
> [06H], DisplayModel [17H]); for Intel Atom processors (family [06H],
> DisplayModel [1CH]): the time-stamp counter increments at a constant rate.

It also says:

> Processor's support for invariant TSC is indicated by
> CPUID.80000007H:EDX[8].

This we can test:

{% highlight C %}
uint32_t __attribute__ ((noinline))  cpuid (void)
{
    asm (
      "mov $0x80000007, %eax\n"
      "cpuid\n"
      "mov %edx, %eax\n"
    );
}

void test (void)
{
    printf ("%X\n", cpuid ());
}
{% endhighlight %}

prints

    100

which indicates that the bit is set.

Additional testing confirms this:

{% highlight C %}
void __attribute__ ((noinline)) rdtsc (uint64_t * p)
{
    asm (
      "lfence\n"
      "rdtsc\n"
      "mov %eax,(%rdi)\n"
      "mov %edx, 4(%rdi)\n"
    );
}

uint64_t micros (void)
{
  struct timeval time;
  gettimeofday (&time, 0);

  return time.tv_sec * 1000000 + time.tv_usec;
}

void delay (void)
{
   int i;
   double s = 0;

   for (i = 1; i < 1000000000; i++) s += 1.0 / i;
   printf ("%f\n", s);
}


void test (void)
{
   uint64_t t0, t1;
   uint64_t c0, c1;

   t0 = micros ();
   rdtsc (&c0);
   sleep (10);
//   delay ();
   t1 = micros ();
   rdtsc (&c1);
   printf ("time: %d; clocks/nano: %f\n", (t1 - t0), (c1 - c0) / 1000.0 / (t1 - t0));
}
{% endhighlight %}

Let's enable turbo boost and run it at known processor:

    # taskset 1 ./t
    time: 10000102; clocls/nano: 2.399990

While it is running, we'll check the clock speed of processor zero:

    # cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep MHz |head -n 1
    cpu MHz         : 1337.156

Now we comment out `sleep`, uncomment `delay` and repeat:

    # taskset 1 ./t
    time: 8478796; clocls/nano: 2.399991

And the clock speed is

    # cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep MHz |head -n 1
    cpu MHz         : 3199.968


The rate of the `rdtsc` is the same and it equals to the nominal clock rate of the processor, which in both cases differed from the real clock rate
of the corresponding core.

This means that TSC is quite safe to use on these processors. One way to do this is by using the function `clock_gettime` mentioned above. It has a clock id
that corresponds to TSC: `CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID`.

The speed, however, isn't great: we get 343 ns per call.

There is a better option: we keep using the `gettimeofday` but set the TSC as a preferable time source for the entire system. This is very easy:

    echo tsc > /sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource0/current_clocksource

To return it back to HPET we do the same, but use "hpet" instead of "tsc".

This is temporary (does not survive reboot). Let's go straight back to our **Java** program and put two zeroes back into the repetition count.
The result is amazing:

    # java Time
    Sum = 2414988828092895332; time = 3636; or 36.36 ns / iter
    Sum = 2414989192017338494; time = 3628; or 36.28 ns / iter
    Sum = 2414989551179770420; time = 3604; or 36.04 ns / iter

This isn't as good as in Windows (there it was under 4 ns), but still much better than before, and, probably, practically usable for the use cases
listed in the beginning.

If we time `gettimeofday()`, we get:

    time for 100000000: 3.000262 s; ns/iter=30.002621

Since `gettimeofday()` returns time in microseconds, the natural limit of its resolution is 1000 ns, and it is indeed achieved. If we call this function many times
and print the differences between consecutive values, we get many zeroes and occasional ones.

The same test for `clock_gettime (CLOCK_REALTIME)` returns 30 ns -- exactly the same as the execution time of each call, which is expected.

In short, the TSC time source is both very fast and very accurate, with two reservations:

- on some systems there may be reasons not to use it
- the `clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME_COARSE)` is faster.

Multi-threaded performance
--------------------------

The `currentTimeMillis()` based on HPET runs for 640 ns (1.5M operations/second). Is this per core or for the entire system?
Let's run a similar test to `Time.java`, but start N threads, where N is between 1 and 24 (the total number of cores in our dual-processor system,
including hyper-threading ones).

Here are the results for the small numbers of threads:

<table class="numeric">
<tr><th>Thread count</th><th>Avg time/call, ns</th><th>Total calls/sec, mil</th></tr>
<tr><td> 1 </td><td>  644 </td><td> 1.55 </td></tr>
<tr><td> 2 </td><td>  918 </td><td> 2.18 </td></tr>
<tr><td> 3 </td><td> 1366 </td><td> 2.20 </td></tr>
<tr><td> 4 </td><td> 1871 </td><td> 2.14 </td></tr>
</table>

Here is the average time it takes to execute `currentTimeMillis()` for all thread counts:

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/currenttimemillis-avgtime.png" width="588" height="356">

This looks quite linear, which makes us suspect that the HPET chip serialises the requests, only serving one at a time.  Or, possibly, a little bit more than one,
judging from the transition from thread count 1 to thread count 2, where the performance didn't halve, but rather dropped by 1.5 times.

Here is the graph of the total performance of the system (the number of calls that can be performed on all cores and processors, in one second):

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/currenttimemillis-callspersec.png" width="594" height="355">

The performance went up from 1.5M to about 2.1M op/sec and stayed there. The initial increase may have something to do with the fact that we're testing on a dual-processor
system. Here are the times measured when the execution is limited to one processor (`taskset 0x555`):


<table class="numeric">
<tr><th>Thread count</th><th>Avg time/call, ns, two processors</th><th>Avg time/call, ns, one processor</th></tr>
<tr><td> 1 </td><td>  644 </td><td> 596 </td></tr>
<tr><td> 2 </td><td>  918 </td><td> 1105 </td></tr>
<tr><td> 3 </td><td> 1366 </td><td> 1672 </td></tr>
<tr><td> 4 </td><td> 1871 </td><td> 2245 </td></tr>
</table>

The single-processor time does not show that abnormal step between one and two threads; it is roughly proportional to the number of threads
and (except for the value for one thread) is longer than the dual-processor time.

Testing with multiple processes gives similar results to that with multiple threads.

In short, the performance of the HPET is indeed limited system-wide. Not more than two million time enquiries per second can be performed on the machine, no
matter how we split the load between cores and processes. If 24 cores are loaded evenly, each can perform below 100K operations per second. This means that one must
really be careful when using `currentTimeMillis()` in **Java** programs (and `gettimeofday()` in **C**) if there are chances that the program will be executed using
HPET. This also applies to the use of `C++` time-reporting functionality (such as `std::chrono::system_clock::now ()`), for it uses `clock_gettime (CLOCK_REALTIME)`,
which ends up reading the same HPET registers (although it invokes a `syscall` in the process).

[A side note. Since the processors affect each other when using HPET, there are potential security problems. One process may run a tight loop calling `gettimeofday`,
thus starving all the other processes of access to this resource and reducing their performance. Alternatively, some process may call this function and time its execution
using TSC, detect this way when other processes query current time, which may help establish which execution path the other processes take. End of side note]

The TSC-based timer does not demonstrate this behaviour. Its performance is quite stable, only dropping by 40% when all the cores (including the hyper-threading ones) are used:

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/currenttimemillis-avgtime-tsc.png" width="594" height="357">

Off-topic: A system call
------------------------

We've seen that the vDSO code can end up in the system call. In Intel x64 version of Linux, the system call 0x60 is exactly the `gettimeofday` function.
How fast is this system call? We can call it directly, modifying the original time measurement of `gettimeofday`. We just replace 

{% highlight C %}
    gettimeofday (&time, 0);
{% endhighlight %}

with

{% highlight C %}
    syscall (0x60, &time, 0);
{% endhighlight %}

This is what we get:

<table class="numeric">
<tr><th>Time source</th><th>Time for vDSO, ns</th><th>Time for syscall, ns</th><th>Cost of syscall, ns</th></tr>
<tr><td> HPET </td><td>  644 </td><td> 734 </td><td> 90 </td></tr>
<tr><td> TSC  </td><td>   35 </td><td>  91 </td><td> 56 </td></tr>
</table>

Previously, I believed that system calls in Linux were incredibly expensive. This measurement proves this belief false: a system call isn't exactly free, but it is
cheaper, for example, than an L3 cache miss (100 ns).

However, if the performed action is short (as it is for TSC `gettimeofday`), it is still beneficial to avoid system call. The vDSO really helps here: in our case,
it made the execution almost three times faster.

What to do
----------

The first prize is to make sure that the program only ever runs on Windows or on Linux with the TSC time source. If this is impossible, there is no way to speed
the call up while staying in pure **Java**, and then the solution is to make sure `currentTimeMillis()` isn't called too often. Obviously, one can implement
a custom version of this call using JNI, based on `clock_gettime()` or even direct reading of TSC (in the latter case thread affinity control may be required).
We measured the cost of a JNI call [here]({{ site.ART-CRC32-JNI }}); it was 8 ns. The total cost will be under 20 ns, which is acceptable.

Conclusions
-----------

- The title isn't completely correct: `currentTimeMillis()` isn't always slow. However, there is a case when it is.

- This call is lightning fast on Windows (4 ns), and reasonably fast on Linux with TSC time source (36 ns)

- It is indeed slow on Linux with HPET time source: 640 ns.

- The HPET is shared between all running threads, of all processes so the entire system can query it only two million times per second.

- Even this "slow" timer is sufficient for most applications. However, there are cases where higher performance is required.

- There is an API call that returns coarse time and works fast. This is the `clock_gettime()`. **Java** VM could have used this call and provide fast `currentTimeMillis()`.
  If absolutely necessary, one can implement it her/himself using JNI. 

- A Linux system call isn't as dramatically slow as I believed, but still takes substantial time (50 -- 100 ns).
