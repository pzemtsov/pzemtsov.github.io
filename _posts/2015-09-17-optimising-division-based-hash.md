In ["{{ site.TITLE-HASH }}"]({{ site.ART-HASH }}) we implemented [Conway's game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life)
using **Java**'s `HashMap` and discovered that some hash functions cause higher execution speed than the others.
We introduced several hash functions and measured their distribution of hash codes. In the next article
(["{{ site.TITLE-MEASURING-HASH }}"]({{ site.ART-MEASURING-HASH }})) we learned how to achieve stable performance of
micro-benchmarks (those that measure execution speed of individual hash functions), and measured the speed of all those
functions. We found several abnormalities, one of which was a big difference in performance of the division-based
hash function between **Java 7** and **Java 8**. Let's look at this case.

The function in question
------------------------

Let's repeat the [source code]({{ site.REPO-LIFE }}/blob/28d4e13343b954bdaa4eab3ab27693debd8ce348/LongPoint6.java) of `LongPoint6.hashCode()`:

{% highlight Java %}
    public int hashCode ()
    {
        return (int) (v % 946840871);
    }
{% endhighlight %}

The constant 946840871 was a completely arbitrary choice of a divisor. It's a prime number and it is relatively big
(close to one billion), bigger than any realistic hash table size. There is nothing special about this number, some other number
may work better. It is also possible that some other number will allow faster calculations. We don't use any specific
properties of this number here, all following arguments are equally applicable to any number. 

The test involving this method ran for 578 ms on **Java 7** and 1661 ms on **Java 8**. The only way to find out why is
by looking at the generated code (see the [previous article]({{ site.ART-MEASURING-HASH }}) for the instructions how to do it).

Let's start with the **Java 7**:

{% highlight c-objdump %}
  0x00007f88e10684a0: sub    rsp,0x18
  0x00007f88e10684a7: mov    QWORD PTR [rsp+0x10],rbp  ;*synchronization entry
                                                ; - LongPoint6::hashCode@-1 (line 30)
  0x00007f88e10684ac: mov    r10,QWORD PTR [rsi+0x10]  ;*getfield v
                                                ; - LongPoint6::hashCode@1 (line 30)
  0x00007f88e10684b0: mov    r11,r10
  0x00007f88e10684b3: sar    r11,0x3f

  0x00007f88e10684d2: sub    r10,r11
  0x00007f88e10684d5: mov    eax,r10d           ;*l2i  ; - LongPoint6::hashCode@8 (line 30)
  0x00007f88e10684d8: add    rsp,0x10
  0x00007f88e10684dc: pop    rbp
  0x00007f88e10684dd: test   DWORD PTR [rip+0xb74fb1d],eax        # 0x00007f88ec7b8000
                                                ;   {poll_return}
  0x00007f88e10684e3: ret    
{% endhighlight %}
 
There aren't any division instructions in the code. The pseudo-code looks like this:

{% highlight Java %}
    public int hashCode ()
    {
        long sign = v >> 63;
        long div = ((v ** 2614885092524444427L) >> 91) - sign;
        return (int) (v - div * 946840871);
    }
{% endhighlight %}
 
I call this pseudo-code rather than just code because it contains an operation that is not accessible in **Java**:
a 128-bit multiplication, which takes two 64-bit numbers and produces a 128-bit result (I wrote it as `**`). There is such operation
in the instruction set -- both `MUL` and `IMUL` have 128-bit versions. The result
is placed into `rdx` and `rax`, we are using `rdx`, that's why the total shift is `0x1B` + `64` = `91`.

What we see is the result of a well-known optimisation: replacing of division by a constant divisor with a multiplication
and some shifts. It is well described in [Agner Fog. Optimizing subroutines in assembly
language. An optimization guide for x86 platforms](http://agner.org/optimize/optimizing_assembly.pdf). The HotSpot
uses slightly different algorithm (they use two bits less, and compensate for signed values). If the code was written
for unsigned numbers, it could save three instructions here.

The **Java 8** code looks like this:

{% highlight c-objdump %}
  0x0000000002989a00: mov    DWORD PTR [rsp-0x6000],eax
  0x0000000002989a07: push   rbp

                                                ;   {poll_return}
  0x0000000002989a3f: ret

                                                ; - LongPoint6::hashCode@7 (line 30)
                                                ;   {runtime_call}
{% endhighlight %}

This code does not employ any optimisations. It does not even compile the remainder operation into `DIV` or `IDIV`
instructions. It calls a runtime routine. It even goes as far as checking that freshly loaded constant isn't zero.
In short, this is really awful code, no wonder it runs slowly. Perhaps, HotSpot developers considered division by
a constant a rare and unimportant case, and removed corresponding optimisation to keep their code short.

Signed or unsigned?
-------------------

The code of  `LongPoint6.hashCode()` uses regular **Java**'s arithmetic to divide a `long` number by an `int` and
find a remainder. **Java**'s numbers are signed by definition. If `v` is negative, we are going to divide a negative number
by a positive one. In **Java** this produces a negative result:

 <div class="formula">
  25 % 3 = 1<br>
  &minus;25 % 3 = &minus;1
 </div>

This isn't what is usually called "a remainder" in mathematics. Proper mathematical remainder isn't ever negative:

 <div class="formula">
  0 &le; x % y &lt; y
 </div>

Hash functions are allowed to return negative results, so there is nothing harmful here.
It is interesting, however, to check what the quality of hashing will be like if we use unsigned arithmetic (we can do it
in **C** or in assembly). We can't do it directly in **Java**, but we can emulate it.
A positive signed 64-bit number keeps its value when interpreted as unsigned. A negative number becomes a big
positive, 2<sup>64</sup> added to its value, so we must add (2<sup>64</sup> mod 946840871) = 518863773 to the
remainder. Since the remainder was zero or negative before, it won't exceed the divisor, but it may stay negative,
in which case we need to add a divisor again:

{% highlight Java %}
    public int hashCode ()
    {
        int r = (int) (v % 946840871);
        if (v < 0) r += 518863773;
        if (r < 0) r += 946840871;
        return r;
    }
{% endhighlight %}

Here are the slot counts we got with signed division (see [here]({{ site.ART-LIFE }})):

    Field size: 1034; slots used:  978; avg=  1.1
    Count size: 3938; slots used: 3201; avg=  1.2

And here are the results for unsigned division:

    Field size: 1034; slots used:  979; avg=  1.1
    Count size: 3938; slots used: 3129; avg=  1.3

The results haven't changed much for `field` but have changed for `count`: they became worse. It does not mean they became
very bad. Previously, the result was equal to E + 3.59&sigma;, where E is the expected value 3126.69, and &sigma;
is the standard deviation 20.68. Now the result is E + 0.11 &sigma;, which still falls well within good statistical
limits and performs better than some other hash functions. It just does not
perform as well as the unsigned division, which I remarked on back then as demonstrating unusually good behaviour.

This means that if we manage to write an incredibly fast version of the hash function based on the unsigned division,
we have chances to improve the overall speed, otherwise the signed version is a better choice.


Optimising division: unsigned case
----------------------------------

The code **Java 7** generates is perfect. The only way it could be improved is by using unsigned division instead of
signed one, but this can't be done in **Java**.

Is there any way to improve the **Java 8** case? If our numbers were 32-bit, there would be an obvious way -- to write
code similar to the pseudo-code above; instead of 128-bit multiplication, we would need a 64-bit one, and this is a
normal `long` operation. Unfortunately, we can't do it that easily in the 64-bit case, because, as I said, there is
no `**` operation in **Java**.

This doesn't mean we must stop here: after all, we have a general-purpose computer, and there is nothing mystical
about 128-bit multiplication. It can be programmed in **Java** using available arithmetic.

Let `x` and `y` be unsigned 64-bit values, and `A`, `B`, `C` and `D` be unsigned 32-bit values,
where

 <div class="formula">
  x = 2<sup>32</sup>A + B<br>
  y = 2<sup>32</sup>C + D
 </div>

Then

 <div class="formula">
  xy = (2<sup>32</sup>A + B) (2<sup>32</sup>C + D) = 2<sup>64</sup>AC + 2<sup>32</sup>(AD + BC) + BD
 </div>

or, graphically,

<table>
 <tr><th colspan="2"> high 64 bits of xy </th> <th colspan="2"> low 64 bits of xy </th> </tr>
 <tr><td> hi (A*C)         </td><td> lo (A*C)</td> </tr>
 <tr><td class="noborder"> </td><td> hi (A*D)</td>         <td> lo (A*D) </td> </tr>
 <tr><td class="noborder"> </td><td> hi (B*C)</td>         <td> lo (B*C) </td> </tr>
 <tr><td class="noborder"> </td><td class="noborder"> </td><td> hi (B*D) </td> <td> lo (B*D)</td> </tr>
</table>

This is a 128-bit unsigned number, which we will represent as two `long`s, one for high and one for low part of the result.
Both will be interpreted as unsigned 64-bit values. Each of the terms `AC`, `AD`, `BC`, `BD` is a 64-bit number.
The low part of the result can be calculated by the obvious code:

{% highlight Java %}
    long mult_unsigned_lopart (long x, long y)
    {
        long A = uhi (x);
        long B = ulo (x);
        long C = uhi (y);
        long D = ulo (y);
        return B*D + ((A*D + B*C) << 32);
    }

    long uhi (long x)
    {
        return hi (x) & 0xFFFFFFFFL;
    }

    long ulo (long x)
    {
        return lo (x) & 0xFFFFFFFFL;
    }

{% endhighlight %}

Note the `uhi` and `ulo` functions ("unsigned `hi`" and "unsigned `lo`") and their difference from `hi` and `lo` that
we used to extract integer parts of a value stored as `long`:

{% highlight Java %}
    public static int hi (long w)
    {
        return (int) (w >>> 32);
    }

    public static int lo (long w)
    {
        return (int) w;
    }
{% endhighlight %}

These functions return `int`, which, if directly converted to `long`, will be sign-extended, which will corrupt the results.
Here is a simple example. Let `x` be 0x0000000000000001 and `y` be 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF. Obviously, the 128-bit result should be
0x0000000000000000FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF, and `mult_unsigned_lopart()` must return 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF (which will be printed as -1).
However, with the sign-extended versions of `hi` and `lo` we would have

 <div class="formula">
  A = 0 <br>
  B = 1 <br>
  C = &minus;1 <br>
  D = &minus;1 <br>
  BD + ((AD + BC) << 32) <br>
  <ul> = &minus;1 + ((0 + &minus;1) << 32) <br>
       = 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF + 0xFFFFFFFF00000000 <br>
       = 0xFFFFFFFEFFFFFFFF
 </div>

The code using `uhi`, `ulo` works correctly:

 <div class="formula">
  A = 0 <br>
  B = 1 <br>
  C = 0xFFFFFFFF <br>
  D = 0xFFFFFFFF <br>
  BD + ((AD + BC) << 32) <br>
  <ul> = 0xFFFFFFFF + ((0 + 0xFFFFFFFF) << 32) <br>
       = 0xFFFFFFFF + 0xFFFFFFFF00000000 <br>
       = 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
 </div>

The `mult_unsigned_lopart` was shown here for completeness; we don't need it for our remainder problem.
The pseudo-code of `hashCode()` above (the one using the `**` operation) shifts
the multiplication result by 91, which totally ignores the low part of the product.

It may seem that the following code will calculate the high part:

{% highlight Java %}
    static long mult_unsigned_hipart (long x, long y)
    {
        long A = uhi (x);
        long B = ulo (x);
        long C = uhi (y);
        long D = ulo (y);
        return A*C + ((A*D + B*C) >>> 32);
    }
{% endhighlight %}

This, however, does not work --  for two reasons. One is that `(A*D + B*C)` can occupy 65 bits (a carry bit may be produced
during addition), and another one is that, although `B*D` term is not included directly into the result, it can
produce carry when its high part is added to the low part of `A*D + B*C`. We have to perform addition in 32-bit blocks
and add all the carry bits manually, according to the picture above:

{% highlight Java %}
    static long mult_unsigned_hipart (long x, long y)
    {
        long A = uhi (x);
        long B = ulo (x);
        long C = uhi (y);
        long D = ulo (y);

        long AC = A * C;
        long AD = A * D;
        long BC = B * C;
        long BD = B * D;

        long ADl_BCl_BDh = ulo (AD) + ulo (BC) + uhi (BD);
        return AC + uhi (AD) + uhi (BC) + uhi (ADl_BCl_BDh);
    }
{% endhighlight %}

Now it is very easy to program the hash function:

{% highlight Java %}
    public int hashCode ()
    {
        long div = mult_unsigned_hipart (v, 2614885092524444427L) >> 27;
        return (int) (v - div * 946840871);
    }
{% endhighlight %}

It seems very unlikely that this monster will work faster than the original code. It contains five multiplications, one
shift and six additions. This makes it a very interesting test: how fast can it possibly run?


Optimising division: signed case
----------------------------------

The code in the previous section performed unsigned multiplication and calculated unsigned remainder. As we saw, a signed
version is potentially better, unless it is too slow. How can we modify the code to work in signed case?

The formulae we used above:

 <div class="formula">
  x = 2<sup>32</sup>A + B<br>
  y = 2<sup>32</sup>C + D<br>
  xy = (2<sup>32</sup>A + B) (2<sup>32</sup>C + D)<br>
  <ul>= 2<sup>64</sup>AC + 2<sup>32</sup>(AD + BC) + BD</ul>
 </div>

are still applicable if _x_ and _y_ are signed 64-bit numbers. In this case A and C are signed 32-bit values,
while B and D are unsigned. The picture stays the same, except for important change: AC and BD can now be negative,
so the values must be sign-extended before addition:

<table>
 <tr><th colspan="2"> high 64 bits of xy </th> <th colspan="2"> low 64 bits of xy </th> </tr>
 <tr><td> hi (A*C)   </td><td> lo (A*C)</td> </tr>
 <tr><td> sign (A*D) </td><td> hi (A*D)</td>       <td> lo (A*D) </td> </tr>
 <tr><td> sign (B*C) </td><td> hi (B*C)</td>       <td> lo (B*C) </td> </tr>
 <tr><td class="noborder"> </td><td class="noborder"> </td><td> hi (B*D) </td> <td> lo (B*D)</td> </tr>
</table>

Here sign(v) is a 32-bit sign extension of v. Note that BD must not be sign-extended, since it is a positive value.
These sign manipulations can be implemented very easily by using `hi` and `lo` instead of `uhi` and `ulo` where appropriate:

{% highlight Java %}
    static long mult_signed_hipart (long x, long y)
    {
        long A = hi (x);
        long B = ulo (x);
        long C = hi (y);
        long D = ulo (y);
                   
        long AC = A * C;
        long AD = A * D;
        long BC = B * C;
        long BD = B * D;
        
        long ADl_BCl_BDh = ulo (AD) + ulo (BC) + uhi (BD);
        return AC + hi (AD) + hi (BC) + uhi (ADl_BCl_BDh);
    }
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, the signed version of the hash function:

{% highlight Java %}
    public int hashCode ()
    {
        long sign = v >> 63;
        long div = (mult_signed_hipart (v, 2614885092524444427L) >> 27) - sign;
        return (int) (v - div * 946840871);
    }
{% endhighlight %}

Performance measurements
------------------------

Let's add new unsigned and signed versions to our hash function test suit (they'll be called
[`LongPoint60`]({{ site.REPO-LIFE }}/blob/d59b6b9a681d60ff011a6b800f8d5f63851eeb83/LongPoint60.java)
 and
[`LongPoint61`]({{ site.REPO-LIFE }}/blob/d59b6b9a681d60ff011a6b800f8d5f63851eeb83/LongPoint61.java)
to indicate the fact that they are modified versions of `LongPoint6`).

The full new test suite is [here]({{ site.REPO-LIFE }}/tree/d59b6b9a681d60ff011a6b800f8d5f63851eeb83).
The class to run is `HashTime1`.

Here are the results (in milliseconds for 100M iterations):

<table class="numeric">
<tr><th>Class name</th>                <th>Comment</th>                           <th>Time, <b>Java 7</b></th><th>Time, <b>Java 8</b></th></tr>

</table>

The results are surprising. Our optimisation did work! The code above, being rather long and complex, still runs faster than
the modulo operation as implemented by **Java 8**. And quite a bit faster: if we subtract the calling overhead
(measured as the time of `NullPoint`), we get:

<table class="numeric">
<tr><th>Class name</th>                <th>Comment</th>                              <th>Time, <b>Java&nbsp;7</b></th><th>Time, <b>Java&nbsp;8</b></th></tr>
<tr><td class="label">LongPoint6</td>  <td class="ttext">Modulo big prime            </td><td>  46</td><td> 1200</td></tr>
<tr><td class="label">LongPoint60</td> <td class="ttext">Modulo optimised, unsigned  </td><td> 108</td><td>  155</td></tr>
<tr><td class="label">LongPoint61</td> <td class="ttext">Modulo optimised, signed    </td><td> 197</td><td>  272</td></tr>
</table>

Some observations:

- On **Java 8**, the optimised code, with its five multiplications, is still 7.4 times faster than the original code in unsigned case
and 4.4 times faster in signed case.
- The signed case is quite a bit slower than the unsigned case (I'm not sure why).
- **Java 8** is quite a bit slower than **Java 7** in all cases; it just happens that the optimised versions in **Java 8**
are faster than the original one. Nothing beats unoptimised **Java 7** version.
- In CPU cycles the times are: 

<table class="numeric">
<tr><th>Class name</th>                <th>Comment</th>                              <th>Cycles, <b>Java&nbsp;7</b></th><th>Cycles, <b>Java&nbsp;8</b></th></tr>
<tr><td class="label">LongPoint6</td>  <td class="ttext">Modulo big prime            </td><td> 1.2 </td><td> 31.2</td></tr>
<tr><td class="label">LongPoint60</td> <td class="ttext">Modulo optimised, unsigned  </td><td> 2.8  </td><td> 4.0</td></tr>
<tr><td class="label">LongPoint61</td> <td class="ttext">Modulo optimised, signed    </td><td> 5.1  </td><td> 7.0</td></tr>
</table>

Even though **Java 8** figures are bigger than those of **Java 7**, they are still surprisingly small. The processor must
be very advanced to calculate our unsigned version in 4 cycles.

The disassembly
---------------

Just out of curiosity, let's look at the code generated for our functions. Each of them is compiled twice by **Java 8**,
we'll look at the second output. This is the code for the unsigned version (`LongPoint60`):

Both of these pieces look like a very good code for me. It is a mystery why the second one runs so much slower than the
first one. It is still amazing that both run much faster than a runtime call, which performs s `DIV` instruction.

A full test
-----------

How do the optimised versions perform in the full test (a Life application)? Let's try them.
Here are the times (in milliseconds for 10,000 iterations). Note that they are a bit unstable due to garbage collection:

As we see, the versions using the code we've developed today are slower than the one using normal division on **Java 7**,
but faster on **Java 8**, especially the unsigned version (by 6.6%). The optimisation did indeed work -- however, the results
are worse than on **Java 7**, which performs native optimisation for constant division. The results are also worse than the
multiplication-based ones (`LongPoint4` and `LongPoint5`), so one of these two is probably the better choice on **Java 8**.

Conclusions
-----------

- A division operation is very slow compared to other arithmetic; it should be avoided in performance-critical code

- On the contrary, a multiplication operation is relatively fast; it still makes sense to replace multiplication by
small constants with shifts, additions or `LEA` instructions, but compilers are usually good at that.

- Replacing division by a constant with a multiplication by a reciprocal is a very useful optimisation; it's a pity it
has been removed from **Java** VM in version 8.

- This optimisation requires a 128-bit multiplication, which isn't available in **Java** directly. It can be implemented
from scratch, although in some ugly way.

- The code we produced was very long. It contained five multiplications and several shifts and additions; still, it
was faster than the original code using division (on **Java 8**).

- Still, the optimisation didn't make the division-based hash function the version of choice on **Java 8**, as it was on **Java 7**.

Coming soon
-----------

The CRC-based hash function has improved a lot in **Java 8**: from 10109 to 1882 ms in the stand-alone test and from 9849 to 3400 ms
in the integrated test. This is still quite a bit slower than the other functions (including division-based). Can it be improved?
We'll look at it in one of the next articles.
