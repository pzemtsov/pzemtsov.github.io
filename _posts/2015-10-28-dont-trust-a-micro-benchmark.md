In ["{{ site.TITLE-HASH }}"]({{ site.ART-HASH }}) we implemented [Conway's game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) using **Java**'s `HashMap`.
We discovered that performance depends on a choice of a hash function. In ["{{ site.TITLE-MEASURING-HASH }}"]({{ site.ART-MEASURING-HASH }}) we developed a method
to measure the speed of the hash functions in separation from the rest of the code (as a micro-benchmark). We found that the function based on division (or, more
accurately, calculation of a remainder) worked much faster on **Java 7** than on **Java 8**. In  ["{{ site.TITLE-DIVISION-HASH }}"]({{ site.ART-DIVISION-HASH }})
we found why. **Java 7** optimised a constant division by replacing it with a multiplication by a reciprocal, while **Java 8** didn't. In pseudo-code this replacement looked like this.
The original hash function:

{% highlight java %}
public int hashCode ()
{
    return (int) (v % 946840871);
}
{% endhighlight %}

The optimised hash function:

{% highlight java %}
public int hashCode ()
{
    long sign = v >> 63;
    long div = ((v ** 2614885092524444427L) >> 91) - sign;
    return (int) (v - div * 946840871);
}
{% endhighlight %}

**Java** does not support the operation that we indicated with `**`, which multiplies two 64-bit numbers and produces a 128-bit result.
We've spent enormous effort to implement this multiplication in **Java** and optimise it. Two versions were developed in
["{{ site.TITLE-DIVISION-HASH }}"]({{ site.ART-DIVISION-HASH }}), two more in ["{{ site.TITLE-DIVISION-HASH-MORE }}"]({{ site.ART-DIVISION-HASH-MORE }}).
[Here is the entire code]({{ site.REPO-LIFE }}/tree/c7ace1da74dbe139b5aa0abc952b8d69e1d0be92). The results looked good
on a micro-benchmark:

<table class="numeric">
<tr><th>Class name</th>                <th>Comment</th>                               <th>Time, <b>Java 7</b></th><th>Time, <b>Java 8</b></th></tr>
<tr><td class="label">LongPoint6</td>  <td class="ttext">Original version             </td><td>  578</td><td> 1655</td></tr>
<tr><td class="label">LongPoint60</td> <td class="ttext">Optimised, unsigned          </td><td>  640</td><td>  610</td></tr>
<tr><td class="label">LongPoint61</td> <td class="ttext">Optimised, signed            </td><td>  729</td><td>  727</td></tr>

<tr><td class="label">LongPoint63</td> <td class="ttext">Karatsuba's multiplication   </td><td>  622</td><td>  565</td></tr>
</table>

However, the real test still showed superiority of the original version:

<table class="numeric">
<tr><th>Class name</th>                <th>Comment</th>                           <th>Time, <b>Java 7</b></th><th>Time, <b>Java 8</b></th></tr>
<tr><td class="label">LongPoint6</td>  <td class="ttext">Original version           </td><td>  2032</td><td> 1650</td></tr>
<tr><td class="label">LongPoint60</td> <td class="ttext">Optimised, unsigned        </td><td>  2247</td><td> 1877</td></tr>

<tr><td class="label">LongPoint63</td> <td class="ttext">Karatsuba's multiplication </td><td>  2239</td><td> 1776</td></tr>
</table>


This was a real mystery: why the function performs so badly on a micro-benchmark, and can be improved a lot, while on a real test it performs well and all the improvements fail?

Analysing the disassembly
-------------------------

The only way to answer this question is to run the full test on **Java 8** and dump the disassembly output of the code generated by HotSpot.
When we look at the list of actions taken on our classes, we see quite an activity:

Methods are compiled, then discarded, then compiled again, and all the methods of interest were compiled at least once. We'll look at the last compilation
of each method.

Let's start with `LongPoint6.hashCode()`.
The main part of [the code]({{ site.REPO-LIFE }}/blob/1739c873a562e8ecfc9d58979c2db5f95e10fa81/hashCode.asm) looks familiar -- we saw it when first analysing division-based hash in **Java 8**:

{% highlight c-objdump %}
0x00007f49692c150c: mov    rdi,QWORD PTR [rsi+0x10]  ;*getfield v
                                              ; - LongPoint6::hashCode@1 (line 21)

                                              ; - LongPoint6::hashCode@7 (line 21)
                                              ;   {runtime_call}
{% endhighlight %}

The remainder is calculated by calling a runtime routine, and the divisor is first compared with zero, which is completely unnecessary, as it is a freshly loaded known constant.
However, this method isn't really called -- or, rather, it stops being called as soon as methods such as `Hash_LongPoint.inc()` get compiled.

Let's look at this method. Here is the **Java** code:

{% highlight java %}
private void inc (long w)
{
    LongPoint key = factory.create (w);
    Integer c = counts.get (key);
    counts.put (key, c == null ? 1 : c+1);
}
{% endhighlight %}

[The assembly code]({{ site.REPO-LIFE }}/blob/1739c873a562e8ecfc9d58979c2db5f95e10fa81/inc.asm) is quite long (1250 lines, 3487 bytes), and it contains a piece that also looks familiar:

{% highlight c-objdump %}
0x00007f9d85334035: mov    r11,r9
0x00007f9d85334038: sar    r11,0x3f
0x00007f9d8533403c: mov    rax,0x2449f0232c624b0b
0x00007f9d85334046: imul   r9
0x00007f9d85334049: sar    rdx,0x1b
0x00007f9d8533404d: sub    rdx,r11
0x00007f9d85334050: imul   r11,rdx,0x386fa527
0x00007f9d85334057: mov    r8,r9
0x00007f9d8533405a: sub    r8,r11
{% endhighlight %}

This is the optimised version of calculating a remainder, which we until now only saw in the code produced by **Java 7**. The conclusion we made previously that this optimisation had been
removed from **Java 8** turned out to be incorrect. **Java 8** is capable of this optimisation; it just does not perform it in the micro-benchmark test. This gives us the answer to
our mystery, but let's carry on looking at the code.

The code shown above is present twice in `inc()`, which corresponds to two `HashMap` operations in this method (`get()` and `put()`). It's a pity the compiler hasn't figured out
that both operate on the same object (`key`), and the first result could have been used in the second case as well.

Apart from that, the code of this method is quite impressive. The compiler have done a lot of work to produce this code. It performed speculative inlining of `factory.create()`, `HashMap.get()` and `HashMap.put()`
(speculative inlining means that the compiler, before performing true inlining, emits the code that checks if the object is of the expected class and falls back to the interpreting mode if not). Then it inlined all relevant methods from
`HashMap`:  `get()`, `put()`, `hash()`, `getNode()` and others. This in turn allowed inlining `hashCode()` and `equals()`, this time in absolute, not speculative, way, because
the compiler knows the exact type of a key object: it is `LongPoint6`. That's why the entire remainder-calculating sequence shown above is placed there. That's also why there
is no virtual call to `equals()` -- this operation is fully inlined and replaced by a comparison of two numbers. The designers of
`HashMap` helped there, too. The main loop of `HashMap.getNode()` looks like this:

{% highlight java %}
do {
    if (e.hash == hash &&
        ((k = e.key) == key || (key != null && key.equals(k))))
        return e;
} while ((e = e.next) != null);
{% endhighlight %}

The type detection and call de-virtualisation and inlining wouldn't have happened if the `equals()` call looked the other way around:

{% highlight java %}
((k = e.key) == key || && k.equals(key)))
{% endhighlight %}

because we can't make any assumptions about the type of the object that's just been extracted from a data structure. The missing null check is hardly a compensation for that.
This is something to keep in mind when writing code with virtual calls.

Some exotic methods, such as
`TreeNode.getTreeNode()`, `treeifyBin()`, `resize()` were not inlined -- probably, they were considered cold code.

Similar work is done for `counts.put()` -- all relevant methods are inlined.

By the way, a rather long piece of code is generated for `c+1`, because both `c` and the result are `Integer`, not `int`:

{% highlight c-objdump %}

0x00007f9d85334144: mov    r10d,DWORD PTR [r11+r10*4+0x210]
{% endhighlight %}

The first instruction in this listing is unboxing (a field is read from the `Integer` object), the rest is boxing (or, rather, the main path of boxing).
The reason the code is so long is that boxing isn't implemented as just `new Integer(i)`. Instead, `Integer.valueOf(i)` is called, which is optimised by using a cache:

{% highlight c-objdump %}
public static Integer valueOf(int i) {
    if (i >= IntegerCache.low && i <= IntegerCache.high)
        return IntegerCache.cache[i + (-IntegerCache.low)];
    return new Integer(i);
}
{% endhighlight %}

Usually `IntegerCache.low` is &minus;128 and `IntegerCache.high` is 127 (there is a way to change the high value, but not the low one). This is where comparisons with 0x7f and 0x80
come from. The next four lines perform the array index check:

{% highlight c-objdump %}
0x00007f9d85334120: mov    r8d,r10d
0x00007f9d85334123: add    r8d,0x80           ;*iadd
                                              ; - java.lang.Integer::valueOf@20 (line 831)
                                              ; - Hash_LongPoint::inc@43 (line 49)

0x00007f9d8533412a: cmp    r8d,0x100
0x00007f9d85334131: jae    0x00007f9d853347c5
{% endhighlight %}

Note how clever the compiler is to check both array boundaries using just one comparison -- the trick is to use the unsigned branch instruction `jae`, which
fires for both negative and big positive values. Unfortunately, the compiler isn't clever enough to figure out that this index checking isn't necessary at all -- two previous
checks have already done the job. Even adding 0x80 is unnecessary, since this operation has been incorporated into the addressing mode when accessing the array (`[r11+r10*4+0x210]`).

The `Hash_LongPoint.dec()` looks very similar to `inc()` in **Java**:

{% highlight java %}
private void dec (long w)
{
    LongPoint key = factory.create (w);
    int c = counts.get (key)-1;
    if (c != 0) {
        counts.put (key, c);
    } else {
        counts.remove (key);
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

and [is compiled in a similar way]({{ site.REPO-LIFE }}/blob/1739c873a562e8ecfc9d58979c2db5f95e10fa81/dec.asm), too. The assembly contains three occurrences of multiplication by 0x2449f0232c624b0b -- one for each `HashMap` operation.
All important hash map operations have been inlined (speculatively). Both `LongPoint6.hashCode()` and `LongPoint.equals()` have been fully inlined.
Again, boxing required some extra code.

The `Hash_LongPoint.set()` and `Hash_LongPoint.reset()` also demonstrate some degree of inlining. This is what they look like in **Java**:

{% highlight java %}
void set (LongPoint k)
{
    long w = k.v;
    inc (w-DX-DY);
    inc (w-DX);
    inc (w-DX+DY);
    inc (w-DY);
    inc (w+DY);
    inc (w+DX-DY);
    inc (w+DX);
    inc (w+DX+DY);
    field.add (k);
}
    
void reset (LongPoint k)
{
    long w = k.v;
    dec (w-DX-DY);
    dec (w-DX);
    dec (w-DX+DY);
    dec (w-DY);
    dec (w+DY);
    dec (w+DX-DY);
    dec (w+DX);
    dec (w+DX+DY);
    field.remove (k);
}
{% endhighlight %}

They look very similar to each other in assembly, too (see [here]({{ site.REPO-LIFE }}/blob/1739c873a562e8ecfc9d58979c2db5f95e10fa81/set.asm)
and [here]({{ site.REPO-LIFE }}/blob/1739c873a562e8ecfc9d58979c2db5f95e10fa81/reset.asm)). Eight calls to `inc()` and `dec()` have not been inlined
(however, the calls are made direct, not virtual), while the trailing
hash map operation is inlined and produces one multiplication by 0x2449f0232c624b0b.

Finally, there is `Hash_LongPoint.step()`:

{% highlight java %}
@Override
public void step ()
{
    ArrayList<LongPoint> toReset = new ArrayList<LongPoint> ();
    ArrayList<LongPoint> toSet = new ArrayList<LongPoint> ();
    for (LongPoint w : field) {
        Integer c = counts.get (w);
        if (c == null || c < 2 || c > 3) toReset.add (w);
    }
    for (LongPoint w : counts.keySet ()) {
        if (counts.get (w) == 3 && ! field.contains (w)) toSet.add (w);
    }
    for (LongPoint w : toSet) {
        set (w);
    }
    for (LongPoint w : toReset) {
        reset (w);
    }

[The assembly output]({{ site.REPO-LIFE }}/blob/1739c873a562e8ecfc9d58979c2db5f95e10fa81/step.asm) for this method is very long (more than 5000 assembly lines). It contains three inlined hash map operations, each with inlined and optimised `hashCode()`.
It also contains one non-virtual call to `set()` and eight calls to `dec()`, also non-virtual. This means that `reset()` was inlined while `set()` was not.

The code also contains a lot of artefacts of `ArrayList`, `KeySet`, `HashMap.HashIterator`, `ArrayList.Itr` and other classes. While `ArrayList` operations, such as array
resizing, are expected (I can't think of an optimisation that would manage to optimise them out), it should be possible to remove iterators, at least in simple cases,
such as iterating `ArrayList`s. The compiler doesn't do it -- the iterator objects are there, and all required virtual calls are made. Perhaps, we should consider replacing those `ArrayList`s with plain arrays, although the best solution would
be to get rid of them altogether. Some better way to iterate over our sets might also help, but this is a topic for future consideration. For now, it's enough to know
that **Java 8** is in fact perfectly capable of optimising division, and all our previous attempts to do it manually were unnecessary.

Conclusions
-----------

- HotSpot demonstrates impressive optimisation capabilities. It is capable of deep inlining, which allows de-virtualisation and inlining of callback methods.

- It still misses some little optimisation opportunities here and there.

- Contrary to our previous belief, **Java 8** is capable of replacing division by a constant with multiplication by a reciprocal.

- This optimisation, however, isn't performed always; it requires some additional conditions, such as very hot code, massive inlining, or something else of this kind.

- Some other optimisations may follow this pattern.

- In our case this optimisation pattern caused different behaviour of the optimiser in the case of a micro-benchmark and in the case of a real program -- surprisingly,
  in favour of the real program. We are so used to [a cheating behaviour when benchmarks perform much better than real products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_emissions_scandal),
  that it is very pleasant to discover  an example of the opposite.

- Still, it means that micro-benchmarks are misleading and must be used with caution, if at all. Nothing replaces a full program performance testing.

- Don't optimise what's already optimised.

Coming soon

Another candidate for optimisation is the hash function based on `CRC32`. We'll see if we can avoid the same pitfall.
